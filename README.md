# yelpcamp

YelpCamp is a project I built using JavaScript, Express, Node, and MongoDB to create a website that utilizes full CRUD operations for users.
It allows for the following functionalities: 
  Registeration
  Login
  Create (campgrounds)
  Edit
  Delete
  Star Ratings
  
  It utilizes RESTful APIs and Geolocation to allow users to see where each campground that they view (or is created) is located.
